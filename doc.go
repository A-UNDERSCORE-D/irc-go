/*
Package girc has useful, self-contained packages that help with IRC
development. The packages are split up so you can use something like the
formatting package, while totally ignoring the provided event management
package.

An example bot that uses these packages can be found here:
https://gist.github.com/DanielOaks/cbbc957e8dba39f59d9e

These packages are in their early stages. For the status of each package, see
the documentation for each packages.
