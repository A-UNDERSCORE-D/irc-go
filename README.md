# gIRC-go

This is an IRC library for Go, pretty similar to the [original Python version](https://github.com/DanielOaks/girc).

This package is still in its early stages.

Packages:

* [**ircmsg**](https://godoc.org/github.com/DanielOaks/girc-go/ircmsg): IRC message handling, raw line parsing and creation.
