# gIRC-go

This is an IRC library for Go, pretty similar to the [original Python version](https://github.com/DanielOaks/girc).

This package is still in its early stages.

An example bot that uses this package can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/DanielOaks/cbbc957e8dba39f59d9e).

Packages:

* [**eventmgr**](https://godoc.org/github.com/DanielOaks/girc-go/eventmgr): Event attaching and dispatching.
* [**ircmsg**](https://godoc.org/github.com/DanielOaks/girc-go/ircmsg): IRC message handling, raw line parsing and creation.
